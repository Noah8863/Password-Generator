 # Challenges 
 
 The biggest challenges I faced when working on this project was how to combined multiple arrays into one and then randomizing that final array. This was a struggle as I had to learn how to concatenate arrays and call functions at the correct time to make the program work properly. 
 
 # Things I learned
 
 The biggest take aways I learned from this project was how to properly call functions and how global/local variables play a huge role into making a program run properly. I also learned how to nest certian variables and isolate functions only when another is ran/called. After this project I became a lot more comfortable with functions and how to manipulate arrays with different data types in them.
